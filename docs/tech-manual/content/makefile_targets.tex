\section{Makefile targets}
\label{sec:makefile_targets}
    Makefile targets provide a convenient and easy way of running different tools that the software packages provide. The usage is \textbf{make \textit{target}}.

    Following is a list of available targets along with the description.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{start-services}
    - Uses docker-compose to start all services defined in the docker/docker-compose.yml file. This target depends on \textbf{build-all} and will rebuild all services before starting them.

    \item \textbf{start-\{service\}}
    - Starts a specific service defined in the docker/docker-compose.yml file. Replace \{service\} with the name of the service you want to start. This target depends on \textbf{build-\{service\}} and will rebuild the specific service before starting it.

    \item \textbf{stop-services}
    - Uses docker-compose to stop all services defined in the docker/docker-compose.yml file.

    \item \textbf{update-requirements}
    - Updates project requirements using the uv package manager. This target depends on \textbf{check-uv} and will generate both common.txt (excluding dev and docs groups) and dev.txt (including all groups) requirement files.

    \item \textbf{check-uv}
    - Verifies that the uv package manager is installed in the system. If not installed, provides installation instructions.

    \item \textbf{build-\{service\}}
    - Builds a specific service defined in the docker/docker-compose.yml file. Replace \{service\} with the name of the service you want to build. Uses --no-cache option for clean builds.

    \item \textbf{build-all}
    - Builds all services defined in the docker/docker-compose.yml file using --no-cache option for clean builds.
