\section*{Abstract}

	This document provides technical guidance on how to install and configure LAM Validator and LAM content generator, two micro-services developed in the context of the initiative for modelling the Legal Analysis Methodology (LAM). 
	
	The LAM validator is used to perform validation of RDF content after it is exported from VocBench 3 platform. The validation procedure is based on SHACL data shape checking and is done using LAM-SKOS-AP application profile. 
	
	The LAM content generator is used to generate, from valid RDF files, the HTML representation, PDF representation and index files in JSON representation.
